miniature-jump is a little J'n'R, maybe a bit static.
if you take a look at the files it's a bit diffrent.
the code is written in Java, but its the processing moded Java. if you use processing, feel free to download and try, learn or improve this piece of code. if you don't know or have processing, give it a try, download at processing.org. good evening.
